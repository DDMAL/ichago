Ichago bibtex style

Ichiro Fujinaga's modifications to the chicago citation format
for his Music Information Acquisition, Preservation, and Retrieval
seminar.

This style closely follows the citation format described in the
Chicago Manual of Style, 15th edition.

Many authors over the years. See the files themselves for notes.

To use, include the ichago package:
  \usepackage{ichago}
then set the ichago bibliography style with
  \bibliographystyle{ichago}

The following citation commands are available:
  \cite{key}        - (Authors, year)
  \citeN{key}       - Authors (year)
  \citeA{key}       - (Authors)
  \citeNP, \citeANP - Above, with no parentheses
  To shorten author lists with et al., use
  \shortcite variations
  \citeyear{key}     - Year in parentheses
  \citeyearNP{key}   - Year with no parenthesis
